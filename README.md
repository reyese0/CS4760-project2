<br>Prompts:
<br>Write a program in c (worker.c file). It should figure out what time the system should terminate by adding the system clock time and the time passed from the parameters. The worker will then go into a loop that constantly checks the system clock to see if time has passed, and checks if it's time to terminate (Do not do a sleep). There should also be an output each time the seconds change that says the number of seconds passed since starting.
<br>Summary: The inital generated code seemed to work. I updated the output messages to follow the format in the requirements.
